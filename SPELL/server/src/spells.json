Construct the poppet( voodoo doll), with whatever materials you have chosen, it doesn't have to be artistic, make whatever you can that resembles a human( the person you want dead). All while doing it visualize it as the person. Put the personal items either inside or firmly stuck on the poppet. Get the graveyard dust/ dirt. make sure it is dirt from a real grave yard you have gathered yourself. and put it in and on the poppet, then as you visualize the popet as the person with as much focus and hate, you then stab it, knowing you have killed the person. Be as hateful as you can, then you take it and either bury it in a graveyard or outside the persons home or their place of work.After doing such workings it is then advisale to clean you aura and chakras and I personally like to also have a spiritual cleansing bath(with rue herb or rue oil, eggshell powder and sea salt).",

Is it related to one of the four elements more than the others?. Use all the information to write an incantation which will take advantage of the demon’s weaknesses in order to expel it.  In addition to this incantation, you will also need a sheet of paper on which to write the demon’s name (if the name is unknown, you can use a design or symbol to represent the demon). You will burn this paper during the ritual, using a dedicated candle for the purpose. You will also need an object to contain the demon – such as a small stone. The ritual is as follows: Recite the incantation, setting fire to paper with the name or symbol. Drop the object that you have chosen as a ‘prison’ onto the embers of this paper to absorb the spirit. Pour the candle-wax on the prison-object to seal it. Once the spirit is trapped, you can destroy the imprisoning object in a symbolic way, for example throw it into a fire consecrated by the Gods, and sprinkle salt onto the flames to bless them.",
